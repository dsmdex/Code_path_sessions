# Two Pointer Use case
* Two pointers move towards or away from each other.
* Common scenarios and use case:
    - Searching
    - Sorting
    - Comparing

# Big O Notation Breakdown:
* Two Core Pillars for Big O
    - Time Complexity
        - How long will my code take to perform an operation against some given input? (lists, strings, etc)
    - Space Complexity
        - How much space will my operation take in so that it can perform the operation?
