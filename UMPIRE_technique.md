# The Umpire Strategy
## Understand, Match, Plan, Implement, Review, Evaluate
* Understand the Problem
    - Understand what the interviewer is asking with clarifying questions
    - Generate basic sample input and output
    - Explore more unusual edge cases
    - Explore tradeoffs (memory, performance, code simplicity/refactoring)
    * What is the end goal or vision of the problem.
* Plan the Solution
    - Describe your overall approach in one or two sentences
    - Write down the steps in English
    - Each step should be simple and clear
*  Implement the Solution
    - Translate your plan into code
        - A clear plan should be relativelu easy to translate. If it's hard to translate, the plan probably isn't good enough.
    - Look up any basic Python that you need.
