# Problem Set Two

# Problem 1: Perfect Match
# def match_made(dictionary):
# 	for key, value in dictionary.items():
# 		print( f"{key} and {value} are a perfect match.")

# Add code to your Replit so that your program prints out the following to the console:

# Peanut butter and Jelly are a perfect match.
# Spongebob and Patrick are a perfect match.
# Ash and Pikachu are a perfect match.


# Problem 2: Remove Char
# Write a function remove_char() that takes in a string s and an integer n as parameters,
# The function returns a new string with the nth character removed where 0 < n < len(s).


# Problem 3: Count Vowels
# Write a function vowel_count() that takes in a string s as a parameter and returns
# the number of vowels in the given string.


# Problem 3: Count Vowels
# Write a function vowel_count() that takes in a string s as a parameter and returns
# the number of vowels in the given string.


# Problem 4: Reverse Sentence
# Write a function reverse_sentence() that takes in a string sentence as a parameter and
# returns the string with the sentence but with the order of the words reversed. 
# The sentence will only contain alphabetic characters and spaces to separate the words. 
# If there is only one word in the sentence, the function returns the original string.


# Problem 5: String Compression
# Write a function that takes in a string my_str as a parameter and performs basic string 
# compression using counts of repeated characters.

# For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the compressed string 
# does not become smaller than the original string, return the original string. Assume the 
# string only has alphabetic characters.


# Problem 6: Needle in a Haystack

# Write a function find_the_needle() that takes in two string parameters: 
# a needle and a haystack. The function returns the index of the first occurrence 
# of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
