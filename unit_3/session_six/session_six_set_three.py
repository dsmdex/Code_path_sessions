# Problem Set Three

# Problem 1: Remove Vowels

# Write a function remove_vowels() that takes in a string s as a parameter 
# and returns a new string with all the vowels removed. For the purposes of 
# this exercise, consider a, e, i, o, and u as vowels and not y. The function 
# should preserve the case of the original letters.


# Problem 2: Missing Integer

# Write a function find_missing_positive() that takes in a sorted list of 
# integers nums that always starts at 1, and returns the smallest missing positive integer.


# Problem 3: Word Follows Pattern

# Write a function wordPattern() that takes in a string pattern and a string s as parameters. 
# The function returns True if s follows the pattern and False otherwise. 
# The string follows the pattern if there is a 1:1 correspondence between a 
# letter in the pattern and a non-empty word in s. 


# Problem 4: Binary Substrings

# Write a function binary_substrings_count() that takes in a string s representing a binary 
# number as a parameter. The function counts the number of substrings that satisfy all 
# of the following conditions:

#     contains an equal number of 0s and 1s
#     all the 0s in the substring are grouped consecutively
#     all the 1s in the substrings are grouped consecutively


# Problem 5: Exclusive Elements

# Write a function exclusive_elements() that takes in two integer lists lst1 and
# lst2 as parameters and returns a new list that contains the elements that 
# are exclusively in one list only (elements that are in lst1 but not in lst2 
# and elements that are in lst2 but not in lst1)

# Problem 6: Flowerbed

# Imagine you have a flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. 
# Flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

# Write a function can_place_flowers() that takes in an integer list flowerbed containing 
# 0's and 1's, (where 0 is an empty plot and 1 is a planted plot) and an integer n that 
# represents the number of new flowers wanting to be planted as parameters. The function 
# should return True if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating 
# the no-adjacent-flowers rule and False otherwise.
