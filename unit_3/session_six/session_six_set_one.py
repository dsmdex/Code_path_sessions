# Problem Set One

# Problem 1: Sum of Strings
# Write a function sum_of_number_strings() that takes in a list of strings 
# nums. Each string is a representations of integers. The function 
# should return the sum of these strings as an integer.


# Problem 2: Remove Duplicates
# Write a function remove_duplicates() that takes in a sorted list of integers
# nums as a parameter and removes all duplicates in the list. The function returns the modified list.



# Problem 3: Reverse Letters
# Write a function reverse_only_letters() that takes in a string s as a parameter. 
# The function reverses the order of the letters in the string and 
# returns the new string. Non-letter characters should remain in their original positions.



# Problem 3: Reverse Letters
# Write a function reverse_only_letters() that takes in a string s as a parameter. 
# The function reverses the order of the letters in the string and returns the new 
# string. Non-letter characters should remain in their original positions.


# Problem 5: Teemo's Attack
# In the game League of Legends, Teemo attacks his enemy Ashe with poison arrows. 
# Write a function find_poisoned_duration() that takes in two parameters: time_
# series (the time at which Teemo's attacks hits Ashe) and time_duration 
# (the duration of the poisoning effect). The function returns the total time 
# that Ashe is in a poisoned condition.

# time_series is a list of integers that represents the times at which 
# Teemo attacks and makes Ashe poisoned for the exact time_duration. 



# Problem 6: Sum Unique Elements
# Write a function sum_of_unique_elements() that takes in two lists of integers, 
# lst1 and lst2, as parameters and returns the sum of the elements that are unique in lst1.

# An element is unique if:

#     it appears exactly once in lst1
#     it does not appear in lst2
