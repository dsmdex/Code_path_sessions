# Problem Set Two

# Problem 1: String to Integer

# Write a function string_to_integer_mapping() that takes in a string of digits s
# as a parameter and returns a list where each element is the integer value of 
# the corresponding digit in the string.


# Problem 2: Delete Minimum

# Write a function delete_minimum_elements(nums) that takes in a list of integers 
# nums as a parameter and continuously removes the minimum element until the list 
# is empty. The function returns a new list of all the elements in nums in the 
# order in which they were removed.


# Problem 3: Longest Common Prefix

# Write a function longest_common_prefix() that takes in a list of strings strings 
# as a parameter. The function returns the longest common prefix (not substring) 
# of all strings and if there are none, it returns an empty string "".


# Problem 4: Consecutive Characters

# Write a function count_consecutive_characters() that takes in a string str1 as 
# a parameter and returns the count of the most frequent consecutive character.


# Problem 5: Partition Labels

# Write a function partition_labels() that takes in a string s as a parameter. 
# s consists of lowercase letters and represents the order of characters as 
# they appear in a document. The function partitions s into as many parts as 
# possible so that each unique letter appears in at most one part, and 
# returns a list of integers representing the size of these parts.


# Problem 6: Interleave Lists

# Write a function interleave_lists() that accepts two lists as parameters. 
# The function should return a new list that combines the given lists by 
# alternating which list it takes its next element from. It will take 
# elements in order, and if one list is longer it will append the 
# remaining elements to the end of the interleaved list.
